Technical interview preparation
Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
You are not allowed to import any module
Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity
(hint: you donâ€™t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
6-peak.py must contain the function
6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm:
O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
